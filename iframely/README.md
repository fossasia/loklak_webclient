# Iframely API for Responsive Web Embeds

Iframely is fast and simple HTTP API for responsive web embeds and semantic meta. The API covers well [over 1800 domains](https://iframely.com/domains) through 200 custom domain plugins and generic parsers for [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), powered by Iframely's whitelist. 

The whitelist file is pullled from iframely.com and is updated automatically. You can also [have your own whitelist](/docs/whitelist-format) file. The whitelisting is manual process, and we do every-day manual regression testing to ensure integrity. [Submit your domain](https://iframely.com/qa/request), if you publish embeds.

HTTP API are available as [oEmbed](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) or [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) formats. To make it simple to understand, Iframely format mimics the `<head>` section of the page with its `meta` and `links` elements.

In response to `url` request, APIs returns you the embeds and meta for a requested web page. Below are data samples from [hosted API](https://iframely.com), just to show you the format:

- [>> Here’s API call for Coub video](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.json)
- [>> Same one, but as oEmbed](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.oembed)

Iframely can also be used as Node.js library. 

Requires Node version 0.10.22 and up.
